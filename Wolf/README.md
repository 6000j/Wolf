# Wolf

This is a pretty simplistic tool, and that's what it was designed for, it was to give people a change before extracting the files to view how they will be laid out, later
down the road I might add a few handy little features like a simple packer and unpacker so you don't need to keep repacking the whole file whenever you want to change
something, but for now so I can release these and be happy that they're stable I am leaving it at the simple tool it is.
