# Wolf


Wolf is a collection of tools that allow you to edit content for [Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/480650/YuGiOh_Legacy_of_the_Duelist/) on PC.

There are no present or future plans to port any of these tools to allow editing content from the Play Station 4 or Xbox One, if anyone else feels upto it, by all means! I've documentated everything I know in the Wiki so feel free to check it out on there.
