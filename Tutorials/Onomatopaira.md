# Onomatopaira Tutorial

### Extracting The Core Files
When you run Onomatopaira you get prompted with an "Open Yu-Gi-Oh TOC File" dialog box, this may seem
like a random request to you, but it's pretty simple; the only thing you need to do is point this
program at the game install location, this is usually found in:

`%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist`

It may also be installed in any other location that you may have chosen to install Steam games.
Once you have located the games install directory choose the file named "YGO_DATA.toc", it should be
the only file in the directory according to the program, select the file and click "Open".

The program will then start extracting files, it may take some time and use up a bit of RAM and Disk IO 
so it might pay to lay off any RAM and disk intensive tasks until extraction is finished. Assuming there 
were no errors during extraction you should have a folder named YGO_DATA in the directory you ran 
Onomatopaira from, this foler contains all files the game uses.
