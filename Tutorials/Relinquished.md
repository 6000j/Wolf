# Relinquished Tutorial

### Extracting ZIB Files
When you run Relinquished you get prompted with an "Open Yu-Gi-Oh ZIB File" dialog box, navigate to the 
YGO_DATA folder it is typically found in the same directory that Onomatopaira was ran from as that's where 
it extracts content. Using Relinquished open any of the ZIB files. You can refer to the Wiki for what each
one contains.

Once you've chosen a ZIB file it start extracting the contents of the chosen file,
after it has finished you'll notice a new folder called:

 `*ZIB FILE NAME* Unpacked`

Where *ZIB FILE NAME* is the name of the ZIB you extraced. This contains all the contents of the file
plus a tool file called **Index.zib**, don't touch this file unless you know what you're doing because
this file is needed for other tools to function correctly.


#### Notes
You **will** have to run and extract the game's files with Onomatopaira before this tool will be useful.
