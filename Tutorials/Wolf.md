# Wolf Tutorial

### Exploring The Game Files
When you run Wolf you get presented with a GUI, to start viewing the files click on ``File -> Open`` this
will load the game content in an easy to understand tree structure. You can view photo files and extract
individual files. 


#### Notes
If the game is crashing on launch, make sure you go ``File -> Close`` this tool locks the YGO_DATA file
so the game might not be able to read from it when the tool is open.
