### Save Editing
Similar to Wolf, this project is GUI based, it will let you modify certain values in your save file,
it can usually be found in the directory:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\*SteamID*\480650\remote`

Replace *SteamID* with your SteamID, it is called `savegame.dat`.

Once you've finished, click on `File -> Export`, it will create a file in the same directory as the tool,
move this back to the save location as shown above. When you relaunch the game it will have your updated save.
