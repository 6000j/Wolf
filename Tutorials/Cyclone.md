# Cyclone Tutorial

### Packing ZIB Files
When you run Cyclone you get prompted with an "Select ZIB Folder" dialog box, go to your working folder and
selected an unpacked ZIB folder, this tool will repack it and create a ZIB folder, move this into the YGO_DATA
folder so it will be included when you repack the whole folder.

#### Notes
You **will** have to extract a ZIB folder before this tool will be useful.
