### Extracting The Language Files
When you launch this program, it asks for a BND file to decode, they can be found in 

``YGO_DATA\strings`` 

Once extracted, it will create a folder with a text file with each string on a new line, once you've 
localized the string you can repack it using the same tool, be sure to put the BND file it creates back
in the directory above so when you run Vortex it will include it in the DATA file.
