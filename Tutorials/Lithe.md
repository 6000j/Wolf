### Decoding Credits
This tool lets you change the credits around, so if you overhaul something and want to credit people you 
can change or add people to the credits. When the tool opens it asks you for a "Credits File To Encode/Decode",
it also has the filter options set to `DAT` and `TXT`, to find the credits look in the :

``YGO_DATA\main\ui\credits`` 

folder, you'll notice a `credits.dat` file, if you open it with this tool it will produce a text file based
on this, make sure you keep the formatting roughly the same as it will impact the parsing of the file if you change it to much.

This text file will need to be re-encoded, run the tool again and select credits.txt, it will create a credits.dat file for you.
Put this file back in the directory:

``YGO_DATA\main\ui\credits`` 

Overwrite any files existing, it will now have you're updated credits.
