# Vortex

This is one of what I like to consider the 3 main tools. It handles pulling all the files back together and turning them into the DAT file
It also generates the TOC file for you, as a note, you need to point this file at the YGO_DATA directory of the extracted files.

Run Options:
``
Vortex.exe [PATH TO YGO_DATA]
``

Optional Argumens:
``
None
``
