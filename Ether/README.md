# Ether

This is a utility tool that uses a few functions that I found I needed to use Google for, like hashing files or converting hex to dec and vise versa.
It probably won't be helpful to you other than the "back up" files which it just copies them to another directoy for faster restoration thatn Steam if you have slow internet.
