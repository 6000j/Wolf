Do this checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request along side it.
- [ ] Is this au sage question?
- [ ] Is this an idea for a feature?

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that I can help. If the info is missing I will probably add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal example** that reproduces the bug.
- [ ] Provide **screenshots** where appropriate
- [ ] What's the **Git SHA** of the live build you're using?
- [ ] Have you compiled the programs yourself?
- [ ] Are you using Wine or anything else that helps you play the game on anything but Windows?
