# Relinquished

This is the least important of the 3 main programs sadly. It is the ZIB file unpacker, it is here to extract ZIB files so we can read them.
Currently I don't have a ZIB repacker, but as with a few of my tools they're happening very slowly. I'll publish it when it is upto standard.

Run Options:
``
Relinquished.exe <ZIB FILE>
``

Optional Argumens:
``
None
