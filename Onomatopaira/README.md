# Onomatopaira

This is the main program, it handles all parsing and extracting of the DAT file. It doesn't do any flashy stuff aside from just extract the content and put it in a YGO_DATA folder. You will need to compile [Celtic Guardian](https://github.com/Arefu/Wolf/tree/master/Celtic%20Guardian) as this currently depends on a few of it's functions.
