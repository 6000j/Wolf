# Onomatopaira

This is where the magic happens, this is the main program it extracts the YGO_DATA.DAT file, as a note please make sure the game isn't running 
as to not confuse this tool. There isn't much needing to be said about this as its source code isn't that hard to read through albeit slightly 
inefficient.

Run Options:
``
Onomatopaira.exe <YGO_DATA.toc>
